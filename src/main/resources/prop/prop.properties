release.description = # Description: The present file provides the reliable peptides in PRIDE Cluster. Each peptide sequence is a consensus peptiform (peptide + modification positions) amounting \
                        all the projects in PRIDE. \
                        Each Consensus peptide in the present file is represented by one or multiple reliable clusters (see http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n2/full/nmeth.2343.html)
